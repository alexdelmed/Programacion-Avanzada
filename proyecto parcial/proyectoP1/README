Consider the sequence of numbers ai, i = 0, 1, 2, …, which satisfies the following requirements:
a0 = 0
a1 = 1
a2i = ai
a2i+1 = ai + ai+1
for every i = 1, 2, 3, … .
Write a program which for a given value of n finds the largest number among the numbers a0, a1, …, an.

Input
You are given several test cases (not more than 10). Each test case is a line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 99 999). The last line of input contains 0.


Output
For every n in the input write the corresponding maximum value found.

5        3
10       4
0

------Breakdown
The program has to be capeable to get the answer to the equation. With every iteration it gets a diferent number to get to the formula until the final answer arrives.
Asking the user, doing the execution based on the parameters set.
------Análisis
Fist we ask the user for the number.
In case the number is 0, the program is terminated.
If it is another number, it will be added to the "Maximun" algorithm.
In which it will be checked if it is even or not, and in case of not being removed half by adding 1.
At the end taking the result
