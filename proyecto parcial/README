author: Emil Kelevedzhiev,   Problem Source: Winter Mathematical Festival Varna '2001 Informatics Tournament

Consider the sequence of numbers ai, i = 0, 1, 2, …, which satisfies the following requirements:
a0 = 0
a1 = 1
a2i = ai
a2i+1 = ai + ai+1
for every i = 1, 2, 3, … .
Write a program which for a given value of n finds the largest number among the numbers a0, a1, …, an.

Input
You are given several test cases (not more than 10). Each test case is a line containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 99 999). The last line of input contains 0.


Output
For every n in the input write the corresponding maximum value found.
