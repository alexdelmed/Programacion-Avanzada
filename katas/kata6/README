The goal of this puzzle is to guess the coordinate of a bomb (line and column of a
2 dimensional array). You will have to make a guess at each step of the puzzle and 
adjust it from given feedbacks. Of course, you have a limited number of guess.

Basically, this problem requires a search algorithm. Since there are limited amount of moves allowed
we can't do anything expensive, like looking window by window.
